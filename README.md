# wd101
Hello Guys !
This is my very first small project on Web developement i.e a capstone project  
under the course 'WebDevelopement WD101' provided by PupilFirst.  
This project consist of a neon-themed registration webpage  
in which when the valid credentials are entered in the fields,  
the data appears on the webpage in a tabular format.  
//Validations are as follows:  
=> Name is required.  
=> Email is required.  
=> Password is required.  
=> Age must be between 18 to 55 years.  
The data will be considered and displayed on the screen  
only and only if all the above validations are approved.  
Thankyou.
