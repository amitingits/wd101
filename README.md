# wd101
Hello Guys !
This is my very first small project on Web developement i.e a capstone project\n
under the course 'WebDevelopement WD101' provided by PupilFirst.\n
This project consist of a neon-themed registration webpage\n
in which when the valid credentials are entered in the fields, \n
the data appears on the webpage in a tabular format.\n
//Validations are as follows:\n
=> Name is required.\n
=> Email is required.\n
=> Password is required.\n
=> Age must be between 18 to 55 years.\n
The data will be considered and displayed on the screen \n
only and only if all the above validations are approved.\n
Thankyou.
